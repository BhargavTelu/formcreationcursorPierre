╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:
==========================

1. Open your web browser
   
2. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   
3. Login to your Supabase account
   
4. Select your project from the list
   
5. On the left sidebar, click: "SQL Editor"
   
6. In this folder, open the file: FIX-RECURSION-ISSUE.sql
   
7. Copy ALL the text from that file (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
   
8. Go back to Supabase SQL Editor
   
9. Paste the text (Ctrl+V)
   
10. Click the "RUN" button (or press Ctrl+Enter)
   
11. Wait for it to finish (should take 2-3 seconds)
   
12. You should see output ending with:
    "✅✅✅ RECURSION FIXED! LOGIN SHOULD WORK NOW!"
   
13. Come back to your app and try logging in again


IMPORTANT NOTES:
================

❌ DON'T run it in your terminal
❌ DON'T run it in VS Code
❌ DON'T run npm commands

✅ DO run it in Supabase SQL Editor (in your browser)
✅ DO copy the ENTIRE file contents
✅ DO click the RUN button in Supabase


WHY YOU'RE STILL SEEING THE ERROR:
===================================

Your database still has the broken RLS policies.
Restarting your Node.js server (npm run dev) doesn't fix the database.
You need to update the database by running the SQL script in Supabase.


AFTER RUNNING THE SCRIPT:
==========================

1. Go back to your login page
2. Try logging in with: bhargavtelu101@gmail.com
3. Should work! ✅
